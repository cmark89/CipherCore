-Prevent \n from causing an illegal character exception.  (Find a way to encode it?  Alternatively, remove it.)
-Reimplement the "Preserve Case" option; when selected, it will cause the viable character count to double, including an upper and lower case version of each letter, and then proceed to encode it.  
-Add the ability to shift the translation table an arbitrary number of slots forward, to prevent simple decoding.  Have this be controlled by the keyword.
